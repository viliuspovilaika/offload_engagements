# Offload Engagements
This application is an early-stage penetration testing tool which allows users to distribute security scans to multiple computers. The project consists of two parts: the server-side component (contained in the `server_zombie` folder) and the client-side component (contained in the `control_client` folder).

**PLEASE NOTE:** This software is in the early stages of development. The code may not be fully functional or easily readable, and may not yet fully fulfill its intended purpose. Use at your own risk.

## Contributing
Since this project is in the very early stages, we welcome all the contributions.
